This project is an oportunity to work with the amazing framework which is Ruby on Rails but also, to open up and show a side of myself of being a young father. I had my daughter when I was 19 years old and so she is already 10 years old. And I had around ~5 extra years of experience with my siblings as the older brother since I was  around 15 (giving myself some extra credit). 

But to me being a father means giving everything that I have even if it means being constantly burned out. So my project is meant to allow young fathers to bring something good out of a challenging experience especially at a young age. They can document their hobbies and build thoughtfull projects and give them the ability to have small wins as they advance their projects.

We have always heard the saying "there is no manual for being a parent", to this I say there is no manual for most things. But if we create the manual ourselves, hopefully the saying will change to "we build the manual for being a parent" and so I hope this web app reflects that intention of learning to solve problems and make clear things that were once vague and at the same time have fun at it.

Now with the technical side the requirements included having Active Record associations between the models, also developing create, update and destroy functionality within the Model View Conroller system. Also building user sign-up and log-in capabilities and also login in from an outside provider which in my case I used Facebook. Also, having normal and custom validations on the models and class model methods to access the database quickly. 

I think using Rails helper methods had a learning curve (for example path helpers) but being able to use things like form_for and resources allows to build a powerful app, and allows to see the big picture of building a web app. The main challenges of Rails magic, for me, are dealing with the params hashes so the data goes where it is supposed to and so building nested forms also has a learning curve but it works very well too. 

Lastly an interesting factor that surprised me by the end of the project build was working with front end. I used materialize which I believe is a light version of bootstrap and getting familiar with CSS and HTML was very fast.
