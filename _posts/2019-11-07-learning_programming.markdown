I am a Software Engineer with experience in the biomedical innovation and business management fields. So throughout the years I have developed the soft skills that come with working in research like dealing with scientific and technical documentation, and also the communication skills developed through team collaboration in a business setting. I am pursuing my dream career in Software Engineering which to me, involves working in innovative and creative technical projects that make a difference and create positive impact in organizations and people. In Flatiron School I have specialised in working with React, Javascript, ES6 and Ruby on Rails. But most importantly I have been developed the skills to learn new technologies rapidly so I am very flexible and adaptable with new programming languages and frameworks. 

Software engineering is a field that I am passionate about overall as a person, whether its passing the tests on a difficult coding challenge, making songs with my 10 year old daughter on my music web app, or showing my wonderful wife my latest website for her design advice.

But in this blog, what I really want to try is to give an overview of the process behind my resume/career-path and the main experiences I've had throughout the years. I believe my youth and path has been challenging but interesting and most importantly I think perseverance has always been a common factor. 

To start way back, I moved to the US in 2006 and finished highschool in 2009 and then went on to start college. But at the same time I started college I became a young father -so responsibilities mounted up quickly for the rest of my college career-. After finding out about these news and much thinking I chose biomedical sciences as a major since I had a passion for science/medicine from a young age, but mostly because this major seemed to lead to a good career where I could support my daughter and take back control of this situation. The next couple of years would involve working a part-time job at the local theme park on the weekends, but also getting on track for an ambitous PhD/MD career at the guidance of my college mentors.

During this time, alas, both my career and parenting responsibilities both grew significantly. I had to split my time in multiple directions, and my plans for a MD/PhD/graduate school became more distant as it became clear that I underestimated the timeline of the career plans I set for myself. The responsibility of being the main caretaker of my daughter increased over time and I tried my best in juggling all of these challenges, but always felt I had to do more, even when i gave all I had, and so I postponed my graduate school plans.

After this I felt dissatisfied with the type of jobs that were available to me but regardless, I worked in customer service and e-commerce and I had to continue with these jobs for some time. These unexpected jobs ended up being a big learning experience, in the sense of having to work with customers in high-intensity and high-volume commercial environments, and also in starting to explore working in the world of internet through e-commerce.

Then, after 2 1/2 years of finishing college I was extremely lucky to be able to go back to school to a shorter 1 year business school program, which was not as tolling as a 5+ year md/phd route. This experience was challengin but finally gave me a much needed clarity of what I wanted to do, where I felt I could excel and advance in my career path. I realized that I have a technical profile (science major in college) but also a big passion technology and innovation and working in this field would be a dream career. 

Having studied science and business I started to understand that the middle ground between these fields was engineering and so software engineering became a fit for me.

Moreover, during the internship at the end of the business school program I ended up managing the company's wordpress websites and working with databases. Also while doing interviews for the roles at companies that I was really interested in, I got technical questions which really pointed me in the direction of programming.

However, I did not know yet that my path would become specifically software engineering as this seemed a whole other profession to what I had done, but now I finally understand that the software engineering profession has always been aligned to my interests, talents and skills. 

As always, we don't know what we don't know (until we know).

I ended up having to finding many answers to my career path after years of trying and only until after a lot of growth I started to realize that tech could be a possible career path for me.

So I took a small course on data science with python and started to strive for a strong foundation in software engineering and after some advice by a family friend, I looked into web development and ended up signing up for Flatiron School.

In Flatiron I have learned an incredible amount of fun things. I would have never imagined myself working with different programming languages, building application prototypes from scratch, and publishing them to the internet. But also the most rewarding aspect, which to me is using software engineering to communicate with the world.

I think the most remarkable thing about software engineering is being able to listen to people and then build the things people want. Its much like a craft where you can improve your skills with practice and you can see and interact with the end result. 

I believe that I have been building transferable skills required for software engineering throughout the years like research and other hard skills but most importantly also perseverance. And I really believe that people can have an unlimited amount of perseverance when they dedicate themselves to things they love and for me is to be a father but also building the career that I love.
