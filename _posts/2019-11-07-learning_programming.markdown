I am a Software Engineer with experience in science and business management.  Throughout the years I have developed the soft skills that come with working in research like dealing with scientific and technical documentation, and also the communication skills developed through team collaboration in a business setting. I am pursuing my dream career in Software Engineering which to me, involves working in innovative and creative technical projects that make a difference and create positive impact in organizations and people. In Flatiron School I have specialised in working with React, Javascript, ES6 and Ruby on Rails. But most importantly I have developed the skills to learn new technologies rapidly so I am very flexible and adaptable with new programming languages and frameworks. Software engineering is a field that I am passionate about overall as a person, whether its passing the tests on a difficult coding challenge, making songs with my 10 year old daughter on my music web app, or showing my wonderful wife my latest website for her design advice.

So that is the complex elevator pitch I have been building after many adventures. But in this blog, what I really want to try is to give an overview of the process behind my resume/career-path and the main experiences I've had throughout the years. I believe my path has been as challenging and interesting as anyone else's but most importantly I think the perseverance I have acquired has always been the main value in my path.

To start way back, I moved to the US in 2006 and finished highschool in 2009 and then went on to start college. But at the same time I started college I became a young father -so responsibilities mounted up quickly for the rest of my college career-. After finding out these news and much thinking I chose biomedical sciences as a major since I had a passion for science/medicine from a young age, but mostly because this major seemed to lead to a good career where I could support my daughter and take back control of this situation. The next couple of years would involve working a part-time job at the local theme park on the weekends, but also getting on track for an ambitous PhD/MD as that became the set career goal at the guidance of my college mentors.

During this time, alas, both my career and parenting responsibilities both grew significantly. I had to split my time in multiple directions, and my plans for a MD/PhD/graduate school became more distant as it became clear that I underestimated the timeline of the career plans I set for myself. The responsibility of being the main caretaker of my daughter increased over time and I tried my best in juggling all of these challenges, but always felt I had to do more, even when i gave all I had, and so I postponed my graduate school plans.

After this I felt dissatisfied with the type of jobs that were available to me but regardless, I worked in customer service and e-commerce and I had to continue with these jobs for some time. These unexpected jobs ended up being a big learning experience, in the sense of having to work with customers in high-intensity and high-volume commercial environments, and also in starting to explore working in the world of internet through e-commerce.

Then, after 2 1/2 years of finishing college I was extremely lucky to be able to go back to school to a shorter 1 year business school program, which was not as tolling as a 5+ year md/phd route. This experience was challenging but it finally provided me with much needed clarity of what I wanted to do, and where I felt I could excel to advance in my dream career path. Studying business to me was like obtaining the general education I was missing and I had some great professors and classmates that really taught me a lot. Learning things like for example that innovation and progress is only achieved in an environment of clarity and collaboration changed my life and brought me where I am at today.

Having studied science and business I started to understand that the middle ground for between these fields was in organizations was engineering and innovation. Also, I realized that having a technical profile (science major in college) and also a big passion for cutting edge technology, made working in tech an acheivable dream career. 

Moreover, during the internship at the end of the business school program I ended up managing the company's wordpress websites and working with databases, which really put me in the shoes of a web development project. However, I did not know yet that my path would become specifically software engineering/web development as this seemed a whole other profession to what I had done. Then, while doing job interviews for  the roles at companies that I was interested in, I got technical questions which really reinforced me in the direction of programming.

### As always, we don't know what we don't know (until we know).

So I took a small course on data science with Python which was my first experience coding something beyond a 'hello world', but there was still much confusion and uncertainty on my mind about how to acheive my updated career goals. During this time in yet another 'Valley of Despair' of my career, I almost got dragged into indefinitely delaying my career growth and went back to working customer service full-time.

But luckily after some very valuable advice by a family friend who is an experienced software engineer, I looked into languages like Javascript, and then I finally understood that the software engineering profession -specifically- aligned with my interests, talents and skills. 

I ended up having to finding many answers to my dream career path after years of trying and only until after a lot of growth and some luck I saw that tech could be a suitable career path for me. So I ended up signing up for Flatiron School, while still working full-time in customer service.

In Flatiron I have learned an incredible amount of fun but practical skills. I would have never imagined myself working with different programming languages, building application prototypes from scratch, and publishing them to the internet. But also the most rewarding aspect, which to me is using programming to communicate and interact with the world.

I feel very lucky of to have found this path and what's really remarkable about software engineering is being able to listen to people and then build the things people want. Its much like a craft where you can improve your skills with practice and you then can literally see, test, and interact with the end result. 

I believe that I have been building transferable skills required for software engineering throughout the years, but most importantly I have been building perseverance as my main value. And I really believe that people can have an unlimited amount of perseverance when they dedicate themselves to things they love and for me is to be a father and a husband but also building the career that I love.
