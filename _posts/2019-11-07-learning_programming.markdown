In this blog, I try to clarify my resume/career-path and the different experiences I've had throughout the years. I believe my path has been very challenging in some ways but perseverance is the common factor across my path. 

I have always had a passion for science and in college decided to go for biological sciences. However, at the same time I started college I became a father and ended up having a lot on my plate. I would spend the next 5 years, juggling school and parenthood until I graduated from college. I had a hard time finding a job on my field after college because my career path had become limited to studying to be a researcher and going to graduate school. However, the responsibility of being the main caretaker of my daughter increased over the years and after college I could not keep juggling school, work and family.

After college I felt dissatisfied with the type of jobs that were available to me but in anyway, I worked in customer service and e-commerce. I had to continue with these jobs for some time,  and they ended up being as much a learning experience as my college degree, specifically in the sense of being able to work face-to-face with people in customer service in high-intensity and high-volume environments, and also starting to explore working in the world of internet through e-commerce.

Then, after 2 1/2 years of graduating college I was extremely lucky to be ablt to go back to school, but to a 1 year business school program, which was not as tolling as a 5+ year phd research route. This experience really helped me figure out that I have a technical profile (science major in college) but also a big passion for innovation and tech. However I did not know yet that my path would become specifically software engineering as this seemed a whole other profession to what I had done, however now I know that this profession has always been aligned to my interests, talents and skills.

I clearly lacked knowledge/mentors throughout my early career years that would guide me taking into account the specifics of my situation. And I ended up having to find many answers by myself but if I had known about software engineering before I would have chose that right away just because of how much I like it.

Finally, in the internship at the end of the business school program I had an interesting experience at a small company managing a website and working with databases, which really pointed me in the direction of learning programming.

Only until then I started to realize that the skills that were needed for a career in science and techology where very specific, but that I could excel in mastering these skills to become employable in this field.

I took a small course on data science with python and started to strive for a strong foundation in software engineering. After some advice by a family friend, I looked into web development and ended up signing up for Flatiron School.

In Flatiron I have learned an incredible amount of things and I would have never imagined myself building applications from scratch, which is very exciting. The sky is the limit with the amount of knowledge that is avaible to learn programming.

I think the most remarkable thing about software engineering is being able to listen to people and then build the things people want. Its much like a craft where you need to develop skills throughout the years, and I think I have been building useful skills for software engineering throughout the years.
