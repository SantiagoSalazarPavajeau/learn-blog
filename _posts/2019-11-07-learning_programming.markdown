In this blog, I try to give a walkthrough of my resume/career-path and the different experiences I've had throughout the years. I believe my path has been very challenging in some ways but I think perseverance has always been the common factor. 

I moved to the US in 2006 where I finished highschool in 2009 and then went on to start college. I have always had a passion for science and in college decided to go for biological sciences. However, at the same time I started college I became a young father and ended up having a lot on my plate for the rest of my college career. I would spend the next 5 years, juggling school and parenthood until I graduated from college. During this time both my career and parenting responsibilities grew in what I would describe exponentially. I had to choose between focusing more on school or being a father, and had to decide for the latter one. And so my plans for a MD/PhD/graduate school were not possible eventhough that was the career path to follow with my major. The responsibility of being the main caretaker of my daughter increased over the years. I tried my best in juggling all of these challenges, but always felt I had to do more.

After college I felt dissatisfied with the type of jobs that were available to me but anyway, I worked in customer service and e-commerce. I had to continue with these jobs for some time,  and they ended up being as much a learning experience as my college degree, specifically in the sense of being able to work face-to-face with people in high-intensity and high-volume environments, and also starting to explore working in the world of internet through e-commerce.

Then, after 2 1/2 years of graduating college I was extremely lucky to be able to go back to school to a shorter 1 year business school program, which was not as tolling as a 5+ year phd research route. This experience really helped me figure out that I have a technical profile (science major in college) but also a big passion for innovation and tech.  

Specifically, during the internship at the end of the business school program I ended up managing a website and working with databases, and also while doing interviews for the roles at companies that I was really interested in, I got technical questions which really pointed me in the direction of learning programming.

However I did not know yet that my path would become specifically software engineering as this seemed a whole other profession to what I had done, however now I finally understand that the software engineering profession has always been aligned to my interests, talents and skills. As always, we don't know what we don't know (until we know).

I might have lacked some knowledge and mentorship throughout my early career years that would guide me (taking into account the specifics of my situation) but then again its hard to find a mentor/resources for an immigrant, young father, college student, etc. So I ended up having to find many answers by myself, but one thing I can say now is that if I had known about learning software engineering before I would have chose that right away.

Only until after my business degree I started to realize that the skills that were needed for a career in science and techology where very specific, but that I could excel in mastering these skills to become employable in this field.

I took a small course on data science with python and started to strive for a strong foundation in software engineering and after some advice by a family friend, I looked into web development and ended up signing up for Flatiron School.

In Flatiron I have learned an incredible amount of fun things. I would have never imagined myself working with different programming languages, building applications from scratch, and publishing them to the internet. 

But also using software engineering to communicate with the world.

I think the most remarkable thing about software engineering is being able to listen to people and then build the things people want. Its much like a craft where you need to develop skills throughout the years, and I think I have been building transferable skills required for software engineering throughout the years like research and other hard skills but also perseverance.

I think people can have an unlimited amount of perseverance when its about the things they love and for me is to be a father and also building a career that I am passionate about.
