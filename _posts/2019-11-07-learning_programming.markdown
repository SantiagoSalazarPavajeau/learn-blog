"I am a Software Engineer committed to technical projects and with a big passion for collaboration. Looking to partner with a company with an open and positive culture, that focuses on collaboration for the development of cutting edge technology.Â Throughout the years I have developed the soft skills that come with working in research like dealing with scientific and technical documentation, and also the communication skills developed through team collaboration in a business setting..."

So that is the start of the complex elevator pitch I have been building after many adventures. But in this blog, what I really want to try is to take a look at the process behind my story. I believe my path has been as challenging and interesting as anyone else's but most importantly I think perseverance has become the main value in my path.

To start way back, I moved to the US in 2006 with my mother and two younger siblings and finished highschool in 2009 and then went on to start college. But at the same time I started college I became a young father -so my responsibilities mounted up quickly to stay until nowadays-. 

After finding out these news and much worrying I chose biomedical sciences as a major since I had a passion for science/medicine, but mostly because this major seemed to lead to a good career where I could support my daughter and take back control of this situation in a new country. The next several years would involve working a part-time jobs at the local theme park on the weekends, but also the tolling process of getting on track for an ambitous PhD/MD while being a very young parent.

I had to split my time in multiple directions for years, but managed to keep a 3.8 GPA until the end of my junior year. Unexpectedly, at the end of my junior year, I became the main caretaker of my daughter. While I had the help of my mother, this took the main stage in my life so my plans for a MD/PhD/graduate school became more distant as I was still looking at 7-8 more years of intense schooling.

While I had been juggling all of these challenges for years, with time it seemed that I had to do more and more. The responsibilities kept mounting, and I had just reached a point where I had really given everything. So I had to create a new strategy for school/career path but really just slow down.

So years of effort into an almost finished degree with great grades, did not yield much opportunities for me. Reality hit, and I had to settle with working unexpected minimum wage jobs that had nothing to do with my original plans. I managed to stick to school part-time over a couple more years and was able to finish my undergraduate degree in the biomedical field. But there were no clear job prospects as graduate degrees were expected, and I had little contact with my network after having to slow down with school.

Then, while working in customer service at Disney, I met my wife who was the greatest inspiration for me and got me motivated to go back to school to a shorter 1 year business school program. I felt my daughter had a more stable environment, so I decided to keep pursuing my career dreams despite knowing how difficult it would be to go back to school. 

Indeed it was extremely difficult, the high cost took a toll on everyone and while I think I obtained a basic grounded general business education that I was missing and improved overall as a person, I did not get the specific skills I needed to continue growing professionally. So I struggled in the job search and the ROI didn't immediately materialize. 

I learned valueable lessons from great professors and classmates but studying business in the end wasn't a silver bullet to the accomplishment of all my career dreams. But it did made me realize that: 

* I had still a lot to learn.
* I could not give up on having a voice and a story to share.
* Finding my real talents, interests and assets was necesary.
* Defining my obstacles and reality was the only way to improve.

So having studied science and business, only then I started to understand that the middle ground of these fields in organizations was engineering, technology and innovation. And so, I started to realize that having a technical inclination (science major in college) I could specialize in this area. However, the specific path to take was still not very clear to me, but the only thing I knew was that I really thrive in technical tasks and that I am very motivated by collaboration and team work.

In reality the masters almost took 2 years including a 1 year thesis and 6 month intenship, which hit hard on the pocket. And so after finishing this process I had to go back to working customer service full-time to get back on my feet, and continue with normal life.

### As always, we don't know what we don't know (until we know).

But then when I was back at work, out of complete luck I asked a long time family friend who is an experienced software engineer in Colombia about programming and he gave me some of the most valuable advice ever. He pointed me in the direction of Javascript and only then I finally understood that the software engineering profession specifically, aligned with my interests, talents and skills. 

What finally convinced me is that the field is flooded with oportunities because the technical knowledge is accessible over the internet, and also the barrier to entry can be overcome by learning online unlike other professions. 

So only after years of high expectations unmet, a lot of growth and a lot of luck I ended up to finding the path to my dream career and I saw that tech could be a field where I could pour all my energy into and reap the fruits of my labor.

Looking a couple of years back, I would have never imagined myself working with different programming languages, building applications, and deploying them to the internet, because I did not even know this existed.

And I am most surprised and rewarded by the posibility of using programming as a way to communicate and interact with the world, which is something that really motivates me, having a voice and a story to tell.

In the end, I believe that I have built many skills over the years -and posses the talent- required to be a software engineer, but most importantly, I have sticked to perseverance as my main value. And I really believe that people can have an unlimited amount of perseverance when its about things they are commited to and for me, my commitment has been to being a father and a husband, but also to building the career that I love. 

So I am currently looking to partner with a company with an open culture that values collaboration, and creative advancement. Where I can add value through my technical skills but also through my values.
