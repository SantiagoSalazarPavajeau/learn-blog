I have always had a passion for science and in college decided to go for biological sciences. However I was a young parent and had a lot on my plate. So after college I ended up working in customer service but was not happy with this outcome. 

I decided to go back to school and study business which really helped me figure out that I have a technical profile but also a passion for innovation and tech. Finally in the internship at the end of business school I had to manage a website and work with databases, which really pointed me in the direction of learning programming.

Then I took a course on data science and learned that in the end a strong foundation in coding is fundamental for a profession in technology.

Now I am starting a more formal programming journey and I am very excited advancing.
