In this blog, I try to give an overview of my resume/career-path and the main experiences I've had through the years. I believe my path has been challenging in some ways but I think perseverance has always been the common factor. 

I moved to the US in 2006 and finished highschool in 2009 and then went on to start college, but at the same time I became a young father so responsibilities mounted up quickly for the rest of my college career. After these events I chose biomedical sciences as a major because I had a passion for science, but mostly because this major seemed to lead to a good career where I could support my daughter. I would spend the next 5 years, juggling school, work and parenthood until I graduated from college. During this time both my career and parenting responsibilities both grew significantly. I had to split my time in a lot of directions, and my plans for a MD/PhD/graduate school became more distant as that was the career path to follow with my major. The responsibility of being the main caretaker of my daughter increased over the years and I tried my best in juggling all of these challenges, but always felt I had to do more, even when i gave all I had.

After college I felt dissatisfied with the type of jobs that were available to me but regardless, I worked in customer service and e-commerce and I had to continue with these jobs for some time. These unexpected jobs ended up being a big learning experience, in the sense of having to work many customers in high-intensity and high-volume environments, and also in starting to explore working in the world of internet through e-commerce.

Then, after 2 1/2 years of graduating college I was extremely lucky to be able to go back to school to a shorter 1 year business school program, which was not as tolling as a 5+ year phd research route. This experience really helped me figure out what I wanted and where I feel I can excel. I realized that I have a technical profile (science major in college) but also a big passion technology and innovation and working in this field would be a dream career. 

Having studied science and business I felt like the middle ground was engineering and so software engineeri

Specifically, during the internship at the end of the business school program I ended up managing a website and working with databases, and also while doing interviews for the roles at companies that I was really interested in, I got technical questions which really pointed me in the direction of learning programming.

However I did not know yet that my path would become specifically software engineering as this seemed a whole other profession to what I had done, but now I finally understand that the software engineering profession has always been aligned to my interests, talents and skills. As always, we don't know what we don't know (until we know).

I ended up having to finding many answers to my career path after years of trying and only until after my business degree I started to realize that tech could be a possible career path for me.

So I took a small course on data science with python and started to strive for a strong foundation in software engineering and after some advice by a family friend, I looked into web development and ended up signing up for Flatiron School.

In Flatiron I have learned an incredible amount of fun things. I would have never imagined myself working with different programming languages, building application prototypes from scratch, and publishing them to the internet. But also the most rewarding aspect, which to me is using software engineering to communicate with the world.

I think the most remarkable thing about software engineering is being able to listen to people and then build the things people want. Its much like a craft where you can improve your skills with practice and you can see and interact with the end result. 

I believe that I have been building transferable skills required for software engineering throughout the years like research and other hard skills but most importantly also perseverance. And I really believe that people can have an unlimited amount of perseverance when they dedicate themselves to things they love and for me is to be a father but also building the career that I love.
