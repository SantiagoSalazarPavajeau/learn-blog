The concept of arrays might be confusing when it is first introduced, but once its taken to practice this concept becomes very clear. I think arrays might be confusing at first because from a technical perspective arrays are introduced as a data type. Data types being strings, integers, etc. So to understand arrays from this point of view there has to be a lot of context from a computer science perspective which takes a while to acquire.

However, if we look at Arrays from a less theoretical view they are very simple and useful. In Ruby arrays are a fundamental tool to store information: so think just a list of items enclosed in  square brackets , each separated by a comma e.g. [1,2,3]. But what makes arrays so useful is that we can go through each item and change it or analyze it with the use of special functions called 'enumerables'. So we can find if a piece of information is included in the list, or modify our list to have only the information that we need. And basically the ways in which we can modify our list of items is endless, and it is all done automatically by the computer program. 

So arrays allow us to modify information in patterns that we wish, but to getting an in depth look of how we exactly do this does take a more technical understanding.
