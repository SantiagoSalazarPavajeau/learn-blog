I"Ì<p>In this project, we were required to create a ruby gem to show the use of object-orientation, scraping/APIs and the command line. So the gem had to be able to provide information to the user through the command line and this information had to be extracted from the web, then stored in instances of objects. In the end, I think these requirements allowed it to be innovative in terms of fetching data but as far as user interaction it was quite simple.</p>
