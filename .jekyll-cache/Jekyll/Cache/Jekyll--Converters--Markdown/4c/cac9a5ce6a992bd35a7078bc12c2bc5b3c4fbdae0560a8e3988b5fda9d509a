I"Ò<p>This project is an opportunity to work with the amazing framework which is Ruby on Rails but also, to build a tool for young fathers like me. So my project is meant to allow young fathers to bring something good out of a challenging experience especially at a young age. They can document their hobbies and build thoughtfull projects. My past projects were related to documenting <a href="https://santiagosalazarpavajeau.github.io/sinatra_cms_portfolio_project_task-process_log">Tasks-Processes</a> and a <a href="https://santiagosalazarpavajeau.github.io/financial_analysis_cli">financial analysis CLI</a> so choosing this topic was diferent and refreshing because is something that relates more to everyday life.</p>
