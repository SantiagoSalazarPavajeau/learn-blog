I"n<p>This week I was able to join a team for my first time collaborating with git but also my first hackathon and the experience so far has been very intense and great! I entered the team a little bit late because they needed extra help after they started, but the tight deadline got me into a hackathon “rush” mode and had a couple of days of intense coding.</p>
