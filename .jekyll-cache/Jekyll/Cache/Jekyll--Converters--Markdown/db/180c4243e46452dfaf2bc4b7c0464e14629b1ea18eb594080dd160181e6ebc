I"Å<p>This project was born after narrowing down from several project ideas that I liked. First I was considering another blog like app like my previous project <a href="https://santiagosalazarpavajeau.github.io/ruby_on_rails_project_-_young_papas_hobbies">Young Papas Hobbies</a>,  and even a restaurant recipe web app. However after seeing other projects in Javascript I realized the type of web apps that could be built compared to Rails (like games and other interactive single page applications), so I decided to build a music app. Music is a topic I am passionate about and have been involved in ever since I have memory due to my grandmother being a violinist. So I have always played/recorded music with friends and family, eventhough lately I put it aside alot. But to get back into creativity I have been looking into music gear like synths and exploring chord progressions. So I ended up getting inspiration from this and built the chords from scratch.</p>
